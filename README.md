# test-templates
This is a playground to test GitHub features like issue templates, etc.

## How to create a template

1. Add a template in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE`
2. Create a new issue in the Issues tab.
   1. It will automatically suggest you the available templates from the repository's default branch. Select one.
   2. Fill in the template:
      * In the old `md` templates: Understand structure and replace specific fields.
      * In the new `yaml` forms you just have to fill in text fields. (You can't "destroy" the template.)
